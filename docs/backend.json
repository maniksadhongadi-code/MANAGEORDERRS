To support the management of active and pending customers and the transition between these states, a single `customers` collection is used. A `status` field within each customer document indicates whether the customer is 'active' or 'pending', and the `statusHistory` array tracks all state transitions. The `isArchived` field is used for soft deletion. This design ensures a simple and straightforward approach to managing customer data and transitions while adhering to the no-deletion requirement."
